Ethereum Framework for JVM developers

#Getting started
This is the core library for Ethereum Propeller.
You still need to decide which backend you want to use. There are two possibilities right now:
* If you want to use Ethereumj with a embedded full node, go to eth-propeller-ethj
* If you want to use web3j to connect to a remote RPC API, go to eth-propeller-web3j

#Testing
In order to run unit tests on a mocked Ethereum network, please use eth-propeller-ethj


**Note**: Ethereumj's license is LPGL3. So make sure that your license is compatible with LPGL3 if you want to use ethereumJ for something else than testing
